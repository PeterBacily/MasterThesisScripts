# made datafiles with original flux piece over which it was normalized. To stack: find way to create even wl arrays,
# then stack fluxes weighted by snr, where snr is sqrt of average flux-count of original normalization flux piece.
# check if ok to stack: max wl difference in 1 file to the next is 0.0015 angstrom. Check if in full say similar results.
